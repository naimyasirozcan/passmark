# Pass Mark Calculator

This project was actually a basic codepen assignment given from patika.dev for practice on if/if else conditional loops but I decided to step it up and create a calculator that i would want to use.

This simple page has been a challenge for me because I tried to write whole codes without any help or Google search, just by my knowledge. When I thought I finished it, I saw it doesn't work as it should be, then I asked my first question on Stack Overflow. After 3.5 hours crisis and researchs about input values a guy came from heaven and rescued me by saying me just replace a one row.
